# Sentence Classification in BVA Decisions
 Project done as part of the Legal Data Science and Informatics Course at TUM
 
The repository contains 8 notebook files. Notebooks numbered 1 through 7 were used to code for the project. The analyze function can be accessed in the notebook named “main”. This function, if given a document, will split the document into sentences and classify each sentence into one of 14 types. All the cells in this notebook need to be executed sequentially, and the analyze function can be called at the end. No other notebooks need to be accessed to use the analyze function, they are only given so that the coding effort can be observed. The repository also contains a “requirements.txt” file which lists the python packages required for the execution of the “main” notebook. It does not include other packages that may be required to fully execute through the numbered notebooks.

The Project Report pdf contains details on the thorough analysis done and conclusion reached through the project.

The Literature Survey pdf outlines notable papers explored to familiarize with existing works.

The word embeddings model required for the analyze function can be requested on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/qffdhruba/">LinkedIn</a>, just send me a message.
